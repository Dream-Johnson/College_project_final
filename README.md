Final project for my college 

# 📊 End-to-End Data Processing and Analytics

A comprehensive project demonstrating a complete **data analytics pipeline** — from data ingestion and preprocessing to cloud-based storage and interactive visualization. Built as part of my M.Sc. Cyber Security dissertation at the **National Forensic Sciences University**, this project integrates real-world tools and techniques used in modern data science and analytics.
